About UI Toolkit
---

UI Toolkit is the home for all StayWoke's Vue.js 2 Components.  You can use any of these in your Vue.js 2 Projects.

#### [Visit UI Toolkit â‡¨](https://github.com/staywoke/ui-toolkit)


Using our Sample Project
---

First, you will need to install the Vue.js CLI package to you can quickly clone our sample project as a base to start your own project.

```bash
npm install -g vue-cli
```

With Vue.js CLI installed, you can now change to your projects folder, run a single command, and have a copy of our sample project ready for you to start developing with.

```bash
cd /path/to/my-projects
vue init staywoke/ui-toolkit-sample-project my-project
```

Now we just need to change into the new project folder we just created, and kick things off.

```bash
cd my-project
npm install
npm run dev
```
